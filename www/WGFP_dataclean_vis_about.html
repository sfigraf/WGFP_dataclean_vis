<h3> How to Use </h3>

<p> Select a Tab from the header and filter the data in the sidebar. In the Individual datasets Tab, Stationary datafile is a cleaned datafile without marker tags or test tags and most unknown tags are out of it. 
Biomark and Mobile files are pretty much the raw files but with date reformatted for better filtering. Right now there is only a date filter for these files but you can filter out more in the built-in filters with the table.
If these don't do enough and need to be used for questions that can't be answered with the "All Events" and the "Encounter Release History" tables in the "Encounter History" tab, let me know. 

</p>

<p>
Render the tables on startup will yield tables without any filters. in the All Events Tab, removing duplicates will take out rows based on Tag number,Event and Day, in order to help answer questions of "what is the succinct Event History of this specific Tag?". 
The "remove duplicate tags" filter is useful for answering questions like "How many unique fish hit this antenna/how many different brown trout were recaptured" etc. 
</p>

<p> RB1 is the most downstream of the antennas, going up to CF6 which is the most upstream. HP, RB, B3 are all below Windy Gap Dam. CF and B4 are above. Mobile runs were both above and below. 
Biomark antennas are B3 below windy Gap and B4 at Kaibab park just to make filtering syntax a bit easier in R.

<b> Notes </b>
</p>

<p>
The Biomark .csv file is sometimes finnicky to read times in. If this happens sometimes another file has to be made and it's important to have an backup for it. 
The Stationary times between March and April 2021 as well as Dec 3 - Dec 10 2020 can also be finnicky to read in correctly sometimes which I think is the result of a corrupt data file. Not sure why suddenly the times don't get read in sometimes,
but there is a script stationary_timestamp_fix.R that exists to make a correct Stationary datafile, using a csv called new_times which has only the problematic time entries. 
I also have backup copies of the most recent Stationary, Biomark, and new_times files in the CSV_backups folder.
